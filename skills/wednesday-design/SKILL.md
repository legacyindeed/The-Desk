# Wednesday Design Standards

This skill provides guidelines for creating premium, high-aesthetic user interfaces that "wow" the user.

## Visual Language

1. **Glassmorphism**: Use translucent backgrounds with backdrop-filters for depth.
2. **Elevated Typography**: Use modern, clean fonts (e.g., Plus Jakarta Sans) with generous tracking and line height.
3. **Subtle Motion**: Use smooth, eased transitions for all state changes (hover, entry, etc.).
4. **Cinematic Layouts**: Use large visuals, generous whitespace, and intentional focal points.

## Design Tokens

### Colors
- **Primary**: Focused, intentional blues or deep slates.
- **Accents**: Warm ambers or vibrant violets for highlight elements.
- **Surface**: Translucent whites or deep blacks with 70-90% opacity.

### Animations
- **Standard**: `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` for smooth, premium-feeling motion.
- **Emphasis**: Scale transforms (1.02x to 1.05x) on hover.

## Components

- **Cards**: Large border radius (24px+), subtle borders, and deep, soft shadows.
- **Buttons**: Rounded (pill-shaped) with gradient overlays and active/hover states.
- **Inputs**: Clean, glass-style fields with focused border glows.

## Performance & Accessibility

- Ensure all text has sufficient contrast against blurred background.
- Use semantic HTML for interactive elements.
- Optimize image assets for fast loading without sacrificing quality.
