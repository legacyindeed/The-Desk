# Habit Tracker Project Directive

## Goal
Build a beautiful, premium habit tracker focused on reading and writing habits.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + Vanilla CSS
- **Design**: Premium aesthetics, rich typography (Inter/Outfit), smooth animations, glassmorphism.
- **Backend**: (To be determined, likely local storage or lightweight API)

## Instructions
1. Scaffolding the React project.
2. Design the UI tokens in `index.css`.
3. Implement the Landing Page with wow factor.
4. Add habit tracking functionality for reading and writing.

## Tools to use
- `execution/scaffold_project.py` (if needed, or just run npm commands)
- `generate_image` for assets.

## Edge Cases
- Handle no habits state.
- Handle mobile responsiveness.
